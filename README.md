# Regals Mod

A mod containing 45 brand new jokers and 5 new decks with custom artwork and vanilla balancing in mind. My first attempt at a mod for this game so hope it goes well!

# Compatability

Requires steamodded. May not be compatable with certain mods, if you run into an issue with compatability or any other bugs submit it as an issue on the [Github](https://github.com/mpa-LHutchinson/Regals-Mod) OR report it in the Regals Mod thread in the official Balatro Discord server. We will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
